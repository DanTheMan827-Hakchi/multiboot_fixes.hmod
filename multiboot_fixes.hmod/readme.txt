=== Multiboot Fixes ===

This mod will do the following

1. Separate the game directories so hakchi doesn't erase NES games when syncing SNES games.

2. Separate the clover profiles to prevent corrupting anything.

3. Prevent clovercon from breaking when switching system images.

4. Patch /bin/hsqs to work properly with the per-system game directories if needed.

Once installed, you can just add and sync a .hsqs file like you would a game, everything will work.
